## **Understanding my LinkedIn network**
The following script allows us to access our LinkedIn first-degree common connections' network. The compiled edge list can be exported to CSV and processed in Gephi / Cytoscape / your original scripts for social network analyses.

### **Remark**
If there is no common connection between you and your connection's connections, the results will return the same data as your own. Please carefully inspect whether these connections do share a completely same connections as you do or you have no common connections with this person.
